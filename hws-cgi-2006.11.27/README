This is a web server written in Haskell, based on Simon Marlow's original
Haskell Web Server. It has a module system and can run CGI programs. 

The original program is described in:
Developing a high-performance web server in Concurrent Haskell,

=== Build ===

You can use either Cabal or make to build HWS.

==== With Cabal ====

{{{pre:
$ runghc Setup.hs configure
$ runghc Setup.hs build
}}}

This produces the binary ``dist/build/hws/hws``.

==== With make ====

{{{pre:
$ make
}}}

This produces the binary ``./hws``.


=== Configure ===

There is a config file example in ``conf/httpd.conf``. The server should run with the 
example settings, but it would not be very usable. See the example file
for more information about the configuration parameters.


=== Run ===

{{{pre:
usage: hws [option...]
  -f filename   --config=filename        default: "conf/httpd.conf"
  -d directory  --server-root=directory  default: "."
}}}

The server root is the directory which hws uses as base for the
configuration and log file paths.

Files are served from the DocumentRoot.


==== CGI ====

Files which have the filename suffix ``.cgi`` are run as CGI programs.


==== Debug ====

Look in the error log file (``log/error.log`` by default) for any error messages.
If this does not help, try setting LogLevel to debug (in the config file).
